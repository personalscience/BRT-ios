BrainTracker
============

Measure speed of reaction times, a la Seth Roberts

Instructions
============
Fairly obvious: press the start button, then hit the key that matches what you see.  Play again by either touching the same start button, or hit the "repeat" button.

Scores are kept on your iPhone, accessible from within iTunes and copyable to your desktop computer. Look for the file "BrainTrackerResultsFile.csv". Should be (mostly) self-explanatory.

Note that you can delete individual results (on the results page) by left-swiping the item on the table.

The Settings screen will let you populate the app with random values (10 at a time) if you want to test some of the other features (like the chart).
